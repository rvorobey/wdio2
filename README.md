This project was created to practice testing using **Webdriver IO**. All tests were completed using `expect` from **Chai** assertion library.  

## System requirements

    ```
     npm -v // to check current version 
    ```

    ```
     mkdir webdriverio-test && cd webdriverio-test
     npm init -y
     npm i --save-dev @wdio/cli
     ./node_modules/.bin/wdio config -y
